def cleanupJunctions(junctions, thresh=2):
    """
    Cleans up junctions by merging junctions that are within `thresh` pixels of each other.

    Parameters:
        junctions (list of dicts): Junctions as computed by detectJunctions, where each junction is a dictionary
                                   containing at least the 'position' key with [x, y] coordinates.
        thresh (float): The threshold for merging junctions, in pixels. Default value is 2.

    Returns:
        list of dicts: Cleaned up and merged junctions.
