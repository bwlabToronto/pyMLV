# Def is_outer_border_point
def is_outer_border_point(binaryImage, ii, jj, m_Neighbors8, background):
    """
    Determines if a given pixel in a binary image is an outer border point.

    This function checks whether a specified pixel in a binary image is an outer border point. 
    A pixel is considered an outer border point if it is a background pixel and has at least 
    one foreground and one background pixel in its 8-neighborhood.

    Args:
        binaryImage (numpy.ndarray): A binary image where the objects are marked 
        with non-background values and the background is marked with the specified background value.
        ii (int): The row index of the pixel to check.
        jj (int): The column index of the pixel to check.
        m_Neighbors8 (numpy.ndarray): An array of 8 neighbor offsets to consider around the pixel.
        background (int or float): The value representing the background in the binary image.

    Returns:
        int: Returns 1 if the pixel is an outer border point, otherwise 0.

    Notes:
    - The function iterates through the 8-neighborhood of the specified pixel.
    - It counts the number of foreground and background pixels in the neighborhood.
    - A pixel is classified as an outer border point if it is a background pixel and has 
      at least one foreground and one background neighbor.
