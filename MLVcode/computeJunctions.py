# To be fixed
def computeJunctions(vecLD):
    """
    Computes all junctions between contours in the vectorized line drawing vecLD.

    Args:
        vecLD (LineDrawingStructure): The vectorized line drawing data structure.

    Returns:
        LineDrawingStructure: A vector LD of structs with junction information added.

    Output Structure:
        Each junction consists of the following information:
        - contourIDs (list): Vector of IDs of contours involved in the junction.
        - segmentIDs (list): Vector of IDs of the segments within these contours.
        - position (list): Location of the junction [x, y].
        - angle (float): Smallest angle of the junction.
        - type (str): Based on the largest angle a, one of: 'T', 'Y', 'X', 'Arrow', 'Star'.
