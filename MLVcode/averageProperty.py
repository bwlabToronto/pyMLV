def averageProperty(vecLD,property):
    """
    Computes the average value of a specified property over an entire vectorized line drawing.

    This function calculates the mean of a specified property across all contours or 
    segments in a vectorized line drawing. The property to be averaged can be one of 
    several types, such as orientation, length, curvature, junctions, mirror, parallelism, 
    or separation.

    Args:
        vecLD (LineDrawingStructure): The vectorized line drawing data structure.
        property (str): A string indicating the property to be computed. Valid options include:
            - 'orientation': Concatenate all straight line segments and return the orientation 
              of the resulting vector in degrees.
            - 'length': Average of the lengths of the individual contours in pixels.
            - 'curvature': Mean curvature over all line segments, weighted by the number of 
              pixels in the segments, in degrees per pixel.
            - 'junctions': Number of junctions per 10,000 pixels, computed as the sum over 
              normJunctionTypeHistogram.
            - 'mirror', 'parallelism', 'separation': Average value over all contour pixels, 
              a number between 0 and 1.

    Returns:
        float: The mean value of the specified property according to the descriptions above.

    Notes:
    - The computation of the average property varies based on the type of property specified.
