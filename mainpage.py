## @mainpage pyMLV Documentation
#
## @section intro Introduction
## pyMLV is the Python version of the Mid-level Vision Toolbox (MLVToolbox), created by the Aravind Narayanan in BWLab at the University of Toronto.
## The toolbox facilitates the extraction and analysis of structural properties in images such as contours' orientation, length, curvature,
## and junctions. It supports a variety of research tasks including the identification of perceptual organization cues like mirror symmetry, 
## ribbon symmetry, and taper symmetry in naturalistic images.
#
## @section usage Usage
## To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the demos folder. You can execute the Jupyter notebooks within to see examples of the 
## toolbox's capabilities in action:
## - **Demo_ContourFeatures**: Demonstrates extraction of contour features.
## - **Demo_MedialAxis**: Shows how to compute and visualize the medial axis of images.
## Note that the medial axis demo requires additional components due to MATLAB dependencies.
#
## @section updates Updates and Development
## The toolbox is actively maintained, and updates are periodically released. Most functions required for the contour feature and medial axis
## demonstrations are included, and further enhancements are continually being developed.
